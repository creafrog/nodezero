    Compared to these, what are the key benefits that you see to NodeZero?  Looks like it can be deployed on many kinds of machines, which is nice.
    
    I am interested in finding ways to join forces with other people to make convenient self-hosting a reality instead of having as many self-hosting-centered software suites as there are regular Linux distros :-).
    
    arkOS, which I help develop, supports [quite a bit](https://arkos.io/2014/03/genesis-0-5-1-released/) out of the box.  So far we've focused on nailing Raspberry Pi support, and [as of yesterday we also support the the Cubieboard2 and 
    Cubietruck](https://arkos.io/2014/05/arkos-support-for-cubieboard2-and-cubietruck/) (both ARMv7 devices).
    
    We're expanding our hardware support, and right now you can run arkOS in VirtualBox for testing by downloading this: https://nyus.mirror.arkos.io/resources/genesis-dev.box
    
    Anyway, I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on these projects and which parts you're most excited about.  Thanks!
