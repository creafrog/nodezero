## Social networks
Currently, no support for a self-hosted "social networking" service is planned. You can achieve a social-network like experience using the provided applications. If you need to install a decentralized/open social networking platform, take a look at the following projects:


 * [Disapora](https://diasporafoundation.org/) - a privacy aware, distributed, open source social network ([Source](firendica ))
 * [Friendica](http://friendica.com/) - ([Source](https://github.com/friendica/friendica))
 * [Red](http://redmatrix.me/) - complete decentralised publishing, sharing, and communications system ([Source](https://github.com/friendica/red))
 * [Gnu Social](http://gnu.io/social/) - social communication software for both public and private communications
 * [Pump.io](http://pump.io/) - stream server that does most of what people really want from a social network ([SOurce](https://github.com/e14n/pump.io))
 * [twister](http://twister.net.co/) -  P2P microblogging platform
