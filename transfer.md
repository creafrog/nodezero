###Filetea
Transfert de fichier anonyme/temporaire en un clic.

FileTea allows instantaneous file sharing using only a browser and standard HTTP. Users just drag-n-drop their files into a webpage and an URL is generated for each one. These URLs are then sent to recipients or just published somewhere, and allow direct download of the corresponding file.

FileTea in its current implementation does not store any file on server. It just synchronizes and bridges a download to the recipient’s browser with an upload from the source’s browser. This allows better scalability and privacy.
